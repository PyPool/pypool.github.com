PyPool is a group for anyone with an interest in the Python programming language. We meet on the second Monday of each month in [DoES Liverpool](http://doesliverpool.com/). All abilities are welcome.

Meetings generally take the form of someone setting a challenge to the group and splitting into small groups to work on it; ideally these should be tasks that are both approachable to new programmers and enjoyable for the very experienced.

We may look at getting speakers for future members, but it very much depends on what the group members prefer.

If you'd like to have a look at what we've been working on at past meetings, have a look at our [GitHub profle](https://github.com/pypool).

If you'd like to get in touch, [Twitter](http://twitter.com/pypool) is probably your best bet - or if you prefer, you can email us at <pythonliverpool@gmail.com>.

If you're intending to come along to one of our meetings, please RSVP on [our Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/PyPool/) - it's useful if we know roughly how many people to expect.

Finally, if you have anything that you'd like to go up on this blog, you can submit it in the form of a pull request on GitHub - it's built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), so it's just a matter of adding a file to the _posts directory of the [pypool.github.com repo](https://github.com/PyPool/pypool.github.com).
